# salwaelmohandes/project-2_List-Pagination-and-Filtering

I am going for exceed expectations.


First, I created the global variable for all the list of students.
Then, I added the two functions showPage and appendPageLinks.
After that, I started the search function at the top of my code.
Next are the steps after rearranging.

- Create and append a search bar and a search button.
- Create a new student list variable based on the search matches and the Html.  
- Use it as an argument when calling the existing functions.
- Paginate the search results and add 'No match' message. 
- Append the search bar and button to the header of the page.
- Add keyup event listener to improve user experience.
- Create search function and store the results in an array as a new list.
- Remove no results message if it already exists.
- Show all students first page if there's no search input.
- Loop through all students to find matches. 
- Add 'No result' message if no search matches were found.
- Call the two functions with the new list of student.
- Add global variable to store the DOM elements to reference and manipulate.
- Create the showPage function with two parameter to hide all of 
- the items in the student list except for the first ten.
- Create two variables to store the start and end index of each page.  
- Make this function dynamic and work with a list of any length.
- Loop over the list parameter.
- Hide students list and show the first page only when user load it.
- Create appendPageLinks function.
- create pagination links and add functionality to it.
- check if the pagination links have already been created then remove it.
- create a div and add a class to it.
- create the local variable 'page'. 
- Add a ul to the pagination div to store a pagination links.
- Add 'li' and 'a' to every page with the page number text.
- Add +1 to i because the page numbers should start with 1 not 0.
- Select all the alinks.
- Add event listener to each 'a' link.
- Remove active from all links.
- Add back "active" to clicked link.
- Call the showPage function.
- Add the ul to the div and the div to the page.
- Call showPage and appendPageLinks functions with initial list of students.
 
 My code needs DRY but I hope I can do it in the future projects.
